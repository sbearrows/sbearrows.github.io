			<h4>Selected GitHub Repository Overview</h4>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>Here is a review of some of my repositories in GitHub</h4>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Finance Web Application</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>Created a web application that allows user to buy and sell stocks from their online portfolio using real-time stock prices pulled from IEX. This program was written primarily in python and html and used an SQLite database a phpLiteAdmin to confirm correct SQL usage. The program executed the following functions:
			<br>
			-register a new user and store password as an encrypted key in an SQL database<br>
			-login users<br>
			-sell stocks<br>
			-buy stocks<br>
			    -change password<br></p>

			<p><strong>MyDST pipeline</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p>While in working with Dr. Daniel Sherbenou at the University of Colorado Anschutz, I engineered an R pipeline to analyze
			    data from an ex vivo drug screen assay for multiple myeloma patients (termed MyDST). Below is some of the graphical outputs that my pipeline can generate.</p>
			<br>
			<p>BAR GRAPHS</p>
			<img src = "https://github.com/sbearrows/sbearrows.github.io/raw/master/git_ex.png" alt = "bar graph" width = "500", height = "320">
			<p>This bar graph compares drug treatment responses from a single multiple myeloma patient using a tukey function where treatments
			    with the same letter are not significantly different. For example, “len” and “pom” (short for lenalidomide and pomalidomide) are
			    not significantly different from each other, but are significantly different than the untreated control (unt). This is interesting because both lenalidomide
			    and pomalidomide drug treatments are analogs of thalidomide, an immunomodulatory imide drugs. In this case, all treatments showed a
			    significant response compared to control and so this patient would be highly responsive to all treatment options.</p>
			<br>
			<p>HEATMAPS</p>
			<img src = "https://github.com/sbearrows/sbearrows.github.io/raw/master/heatmap_ex.png" alt = "heatmap" width=" 900" height = "200">
			<p>Here is an example of one of 12 different heatmaps this pipeline generates. This displays all of the MyDST screens the
			    Sherbenou Lab has completed to visualize trends overtime and across groups of patients. In this example, the heatmap is
			    split by lines of therapy (LOT) and clustered by column means. Several iterations of this heatmap exist such as splitting by Disease State (Relapse, New Diagnosis).</p>
			<br>
			<p>DRUG TREATMENT TRENDS</p>
			<img src = "https://github.com/sbearrows/sbearrows.github.io/raw/master/Bor_ex.png" alt = "bar graph" width = "500", height = "300">
			<p>This might be my favorite graph the pipeline outputs. I find it informative and visually appealing. The graph is split by
			    LOT but the size of the bars is scaled to the number of values in that bin. As you can see, we have a lot of patients at the 0 LOT
			    bin but not as many in the 3 LOT bin. So if we start seeing an interesting trend towards resistance after 3 LOT but n size is disproportionate,
			    this can inform the next experiments we do.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Survey</strong</p>
			<br>
			<p>Sandwich ordering web application. A user selects a custom made sandwich and using python, stores that information in a .csv 
				file with consecutive sandwiches being appended to the same file. In this example the user is ordering sandwiches, but the 
				program can be modified to order any number of the things.</p>
