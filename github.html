			<br>
			<p><strong>Finance Web Application</strong>
			<a href="https://github.com/sbearrows/Finance-Web-Application"> - show me the code!</a> </p>
			<br>
			<p>Created a web application that allows user to buy and sell stocks from their online portfolio using real-time stock prices pulled from IEX(Investors Exchange Platform). This program was written primarily in python and html and used an SQLite database a phpLiteAdmin to confirm correct SQL usage. The program executed the following functions:
			<br>
	
			&#8226register a new user and store password as an encrypted key in an SQL database<br>
			&#8226login users<br>
			&#8226sell stocks<br>
			&#8226buy stocks<br>
			&#8226change password<br></p>

			<p><strong>MyDST pipeline</strong>
				<a href="https://github.com/sbearrows/MyDST-pipeline"> - show me the code!</a></p>
			<br>
			<p>While in working with Dr. Daniel Sherbenou at the University of Colorado Anschutz, I engineered an R pipeline to analyze
			    data from an ex vivo drug screen assay for multiple myeloma patients (termed MyDST), a patented in-house assay. Bone marrow aspirates are collected from patients and the mononuclear cells are isolated by ficoll gradient. Drug response is assesed ex vivo, 48 hours post treatment, via flow cytometry. Below is some of the graphical 
				outputs that my pipeline can generate.</p>
			<br>
			<p>BAR GRAPHS</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src = "https://github.com/sbearrows/sbearrows.github.io/raw/master/git_ex.png" alt = "bar graph" width = "500", height = "320">
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>This bar graph compares drug treatment responses from a single multiple myeloma patient using a tukey function where treatments
			    with the same letter are not significantly different. For example, pem and pom (short for pembrolizumab and pomalidomide) are
			  significantly different from each other and are significantly different than the untreated control (unt). In this case, all treatments showed a
			    significant response compared to control and so this patient would be highly responsive to all treatment options.</p>
			<br
			<br>
			<p>HEATMAPS</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src = "https://github.com/sbearrows/sbearrows.github.io/raw/master/heatmap_ex.png" alt = "heatmap" width=" 900" height = "200">
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Here is an example of one of 12 different heatmaps this pipeline generates. This displays all of the MyDST screens the
			    Sherbenou Lab has completed to visualize trends overtime and across groups of patients. In this example, the heatmap is
			    split by lines of therapy (LOT) and clustered by column means. Several iterations of this heatmap exist such as splitting by Disease State (Relapse, New Diagnosis).</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>DRUG TREATMENT TRENDS</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<img src = "https://github.com/sbearrows/sbearrows.github.io/raw/master/Bor_ex.png" alt = "bar graph" width = "500", height = "300">
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>This might be my favorite graph the pipeline outputs. I find it informative and visually appealing. The graph is split by
			    LOT but the size of the bars is scaled to the number of values in that bin. As you can see, we have a lot of patients at the 0 LOT
			    bin but not as many in the 3 LOT bin. So if we start seeing an interesting trend towards resistance after 3 LOT but n size is disproportionate,
			    this can inform the next experiments we do.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Using this approach, we can track patients over time and identify treatment regiments which have the greatest efficacy, minimize use of ineffective lines of therapy and prolong the 
				survival of individuals diagnosed with multiple myeloma.</p>
