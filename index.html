			<h4>Computer Scientist</h4>

			<p>Currently working full-time at the University of Colorado Anschutz as a Data Manager for a large Molecular Biology lab, managing sequencing data and create high-throughput workflows using the R programming language and R's Shiny web application tools. These workflows decrease our erorrs rates and ensure our data is updated in real time. Simultaneously, I am pursuring a second Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder. My first degree is from the University of Iowa in Biology. After graduating from the University of Iowa I started working in a Molecular Biology lab doing wet lab research on Type II Diabetes. During this time I discovered a passion for programming through David J Malans Introduction to Computer Science course through Harvardx (Harvards online coursework) where I learned C, python and SQL. I moved to Denver in 2019 and starting working in Cancer Biology Research at the University of Colorado where I started learning how to use R to analyse my data and create faster workflows. Currently, I am halfway through my Computer Science degree and anticipate graduating in 2022. I'm currently taking Computer Systems and Software Development Methods and Tools. Currently I would say R and C++ are my favorite languages. R is a great language to learn especially for academics and the inclusive community behind it is great; they have so many great tutorials. For C++, I enjoy programming in C++ because of how explicitly each details needs to be stated; it helps me appreciate the abstraction of languages like R.</p>

			<p>In my free time I enjoy hiking and camping in the Rocky Mountains. One the weekends I'm typically working on homework and spending time with family and friends.</p>
