			<h4>Computer Scientist</h4>

			<p>Currently working full-time at the University of Colorado Anschutz as a Data Manager for a large molecular biology lab, managing qPCR and ddPCR data and large sample dataset and creating high-throughput workflows using the R programming language and R's Shiny web application tools. These workflows decrease our error rates and ensure our data is updated in real time. I enjoy creating intelligent solutions for my team to improve their experience. Simultaneously, I am pursuing a second bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>

			<p>My first degree is Bachelor of Science in Biology with a Minor in English from the University of Iowa. After graduating from the University of Iowa I started working in a molecular biology lab doing wet lab research on Type II Diabetes. During this time, I discovered a passion for programming through David J Malan’s Introduction to Computer Science course through Harvardx (Harvards online coursework) where I learned the basics of C, python and SQL to name a few. I moved to Denver in 2019 and started working in cancer biology research at the University of Colorado Anschutz where I started learning how to use R to analyze my data and create faster workflows.</p>

			<p>I am halfway through my Computer Science degree and anticipate graduating in 2022. I'm currently taking Computer Systems and Software Development Methods and Tools. In my free time I enjoy hiking and camping in the Rocky Mountains. One the weekends I'm typically working on homework and spending time with family and friends.</p>
