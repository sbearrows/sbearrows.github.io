				<h4>Cancer Biology Research and Aspiring Programmer</h4>
			<p>The title says it all but let me elaborate. Currently working at the University of Colorado Anschutz in the Department of Hematology and Oncology as a Professional Research Assistant.
				In my role as a researches I use R to do most of my data analysis and have been using it for sometime. But in my free time I enjoy taking more advanced Computer Science courses either online or in person. I completed CS50 (Introduction to Computer Science) 
				with David J Malan through HarvardX and his course has encouraged me to pursue a career in Data Science. My goal is to become competent in python and in using SQL as well as learning more about Data Structures and Algorithms. I am currently enrolled in Fundamentals of Computing at 
				the University of Colorado Denver and look forward to taking higher-level 
				Computer Science classes. I honestly find programming general fun and rewarding and I look forward to wherever it takes me!</p>
			<br>
			<p>In my free time I enjoy hiking in the Rocky Mountains and running through the foothills. On the weekends you might find me at a coffee shop trying to figure out what a namespace is as Iâ€™m currently learning C++. </p>
