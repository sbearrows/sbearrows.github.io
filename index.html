			<h4>Software Engineer @ RStudio</h4>

			<p>Currently work at RStudio on the tidyverse team, I previously worked as a molecular biologist which where I first started programming. Initially I was using R for data analysis but this became a gateway into computer science and programming.</p>

			<p>I enjoy combining my passion for programming with my background in molecular biology to make programming and data analysis more accesible and fun, from first time programmers to experienced software engineers.</p>

			<p>In my free time I enjoy hiking and camping in the Rocky Mountains. On the weekends I'm typically grabbing brunch with my friends and spending time with family.</p>
