				<h4>Overview of selected projects with external links to git repository</h4>

					<div id = "projects">
						<p class = "code_title"><strong>ddPCR Shiny Web application</strong>
						<a href="https://github.com/sbearrows/ddpcrAnalysisApp"> - show me the code!</a> </p>


							<p>Built an R Shiny application for the analysis and quality control of ddpcr data from the Walter lab. This reduces errors by catching incorrect data inputs before they are merged into full dataset, which is shared with collaborators. Additioanlly, I also built Shiny web applications for the analysis of our qPCR data and for the analysis of our collaborators CFU data. My web applications have saved the wet lab members several hours in analysis time. </p>

						<p class = "code_title"><strong>UFO sightings and US Elections Frequent Itemsets</strong>
						<a href="https://github.com/sbearrows/UFO_elections"> - show me the code!</a> </p>

							<p>Used the Apriori Algorithm in the R programming language on a UFO sightings and US Elections dataset (merged on state) to mine for frequent itemsets. My goal was to find any correlations with UFO sightings and political party and or the rise of the internet (pre vs post 1996). This project was mostly for fun and though I did find some interesting patterns in the frequent itemsets in pre vs post 1996, I unfortunately didn't find any correlations in our dataset.</p>

						<p class = "code_title"><strong>Science Dictionary ADT</strong>
						<a href="https://github.com/sbearrows/scienceDictionary"> - show me the code!</a> </p>

							<p>Made a Science Dictionary ADT that uses a hash table as the underlying data strucutre, writen in the C++ programming language. This project was inspired by my tenure in academia working on projects in which our collaborators might be in another state and communicating can be difficult without proper documentation (something Computer Scientist are <strong>very</strong> good at). Often labs will use different names for the same thing or (even better) the same name for different things. I designed this to be easy to use. The underlying hash table automatically resizes if the load factor is â‰¥ 0.6. New variables with definitions are added only if another with the same name or definition does not already exists. The dictionary can be written to a csv file and a Linux-like grep search can be done on the definition portion of the entry. If I were to re-vamp this project I would use an AVL tree instead of a hash table because searching for text using an AVL tree would decrease my run time.</p>

						<p class = "code_title"><strong>Finance Web Application</strong>
						<a href="https://github.com/sbearrows/Finance-Web-Application"> - show me the code!</a> </p>

							<p>Created a web application in python using that flask web framework and SQL, that allows user to buy and sell stocks from their online portfolio using real-time stock prices pulled from IEX(Investors Exchange Platform). This project was completed as part of Harvard's CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science course.
